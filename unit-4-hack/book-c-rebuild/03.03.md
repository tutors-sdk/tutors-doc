# Open a Course

We have already seen this sample course:

- <https://reader.tutors.dev/course/tutors-starter>

This is using the tutors reader (the cloud hosted official reader) to load an example course.

You can load the course into your local reader, by appending the `/course/tutors-reader' segment onto the end of the local address for the reader you currently have running. For instance:

- <http://localhost:3000/course/tutors-starter>

This should look like this:

You now have a local version of the reader running, browsing a course.

See if you can open the course you published in previous lab. All you need to do is copy the domain from the "/course" segment as we have done above.
