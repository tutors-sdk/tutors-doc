# Build from Source

First, make sure you have the latest VSCode IDE installed:

- https://code.visualstudio.com/

Getting tutors running locally requires three steps:

- Clone the monrepo
- Build the Course Reader
- Launch a local version of the Reader

### Clone

Now, clone the tutors mono repo:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors.git
~~~

### Build

This will take a moment or two. Once it is downloaded, open a shell/command prompt inside the folder and enter the following:

~~~bash
npm install
~~~

Locate the following file:

- apps/course/.env.example

Make a copy of this file calling it the following:

- apps/course/.env

This will contains dummy values for some tutors  applications secrets & keys.

### Run

Make sure you have a shell open inside this folder:

- apps/course

... and run the reader app with this command:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

This will take a moment or two, eventually it will report success:

~~~bash
 tutors-course@8.4.0 dev
> vite dev --port 3000 --open
