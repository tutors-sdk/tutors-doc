#Exploring Tutors further

Our quick tour until now has shown just some aspects of a tutors course. There are many more to explore yourself. 

We've provided a reference course called *The Kitchen Sink* which allows you to try out different features and examine how they are implemented.

Hopefully, we will eventually get round to documenting them properly! Until then, it's a good idea to bookmark the course, and how a copy downloaded, so you can work out what you need in your next tutors course.
