Create and publish a Tutors course

In this lab we will get started by installing some necessary applications on your workstation:

- Node.js: required to build a tutors course

- Sublime: a text editor

You will also be required to create an account on this Netlify:

- <https://www.netlify.com/>

Netfily will be the service used to publish your course.
