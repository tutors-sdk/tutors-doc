# Republish a Course

Let's make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to republish a course.

Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space. This is Markdown syntax, and it is the title text for the `Simple Units` card. Change this to whatever you wish - either the title or the description.

Now proceed through the same process in the last step:

- Run '**npx tutors-publish**' command from within the folder
- Drag & drop the generated `json` folder to Netlify


Now revisit the published site to see if your updates have been implemented.
